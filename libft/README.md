# libft-42
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. This project is my very first project as a student at 42, it is about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them. Therefore I had to create my own library. It will be
helpful since I will be using it in my next C school assignments.
